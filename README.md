# Backup-in-Linux-server
There are two files to backing up some files from Linux Debian server to remote Ubuntu server. The Python script sends a message to email in case of success or failure. In turn, the Bash script is responsible for the actual backup process, along with logging, creating zip archives to save memory on the device, and cleaning old backup files.
